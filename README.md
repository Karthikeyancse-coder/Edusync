## ✨ What is EduSync?

EduSync is a **full-stack college management and communication platform** designed for real educational institutions. It replaces dozens of fragmented tools — WhatsApp groups, spreadsheets, paper registers — with a single, beautiful, role-aware application.

Every user has a **unique EduSync ID**, a verified role, and a personalized dashboard that surfaces exactly what they need — no clutter, no confusion.

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Role System

EduSync is built around **4 distinct roles**, each with tailored views, permissions, and controls:

| Role | ID Format | Capabilities |
|---|---|---|
| 🎓 **Student** | `STU-CSE-2024-001` | View marks, attendance, timetable, message faculty, join groups |
| 👩‍🏫 **Faculty** | `FAC-CSE-001` | Post marks, take attendance, manage subject groups, message students |
| 🏛️ **HOD** | `HOD-CSE-001` | Oversee department, approve requests, create department groups |
| 👔 **Principal** | `PRIN-001` | College-wide view, all announcements, inter-department controls |

> 💡 **Demo Mode** — Log in instantly as any role from the login screen with one click. No account needed.
